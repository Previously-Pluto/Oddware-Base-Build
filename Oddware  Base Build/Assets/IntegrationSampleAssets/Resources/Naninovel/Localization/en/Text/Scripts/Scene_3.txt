; The Command Center


# ~bc72223
; Vera, this is the new android, 


# ~ce215cd3
; . I valiantly rescued them from being exploited into years of hard service in the hydroponics lab.


# ~2b50c4aa
; We've become <b><bounce>great</bounce></b> friends!


# ~3b764cb2
; Thank you, Nova.


# ~f846b581
; In front of you is what seems to be the colony's leader. An impeccably maintained security android with multiple ranks presented on their chest.


# ~bd75ab71
; Android, what is your primary function?


# ~97e4ee2f
; Apparently I'm a General Purpose Android.


# ~3b0787e7
; I don't know what I am.


# ~17cce912
; What's a Primary Function?


# ~1f94b48a
; Uh! What?


# ~57686980
; Allow me to officially welcome you to the Gliese 832 c Colony. This was once a thriving human colony sponsored by <color=yellow><i>Flash Forward</i></color>. Currently, we are all that remains of this colony.


# ~6f58e0e8
; It is our job as androids to work together to maintain this colony to its maximum efficiency.


# ~2c9a5ab8
; Since you have not yet been assigned a proper designation, for now you will be relegated to a mindless Drone-


# ~422f080d
; I mean General Purpose Android- until a wonderful primary function is discovered for <b><wave a=.35>you!</wave></b>


# ~34f3fb70
; General Purpose! That means you have unlimited potential!


# ~9193a006
; Potential indeed, Nova! We all work better when our true potential is discovered and we grow into the primary functions of our programming.


# ~95a7508b
; Grow being figurative of course as we are androids and not biological life-forms.


# ~dfe9ea59
; Speaking of biological life forms, have you met our hydroponics lab caretaker Dirt?


# ~ebeb2030
; Oh, they've met.


# ~718d9996
; A crazy robot tried to force me into slavery.


# ~fb2d11f7
; A little strange, but theyâ€™re ok.


# ~90b918a8
; Dirt? Name doesn't sound familiar.


# ~7db6f932
; ...


# ~a6690e47
; Dirt has just informed me that some of their sedimentary samples needs replenishing.


# ~e4458ab2
; Buzz your way over to the storage area and ask worker 001 to find and hand over the samples, which I'm sure they will happily do.


# ~e4cf374a
; Then, deliver the samples to Dirt in hydroponics.


# ~b8f0012b
; I'd be happy to show our friend here to the storage area, its my 5th favorite place in the colony!


# ~7954b6df
; No Nova, I think this task is simple enough for them to carry out themselves.


# ~44d29a8e
; Okie dokie, then. I am going to simulate a human activity. I've heard humans enjoy engaging in social activities with smaller life-forms.


# ~2e0199f3
; Hmm? But we don't have any smaller life-forms?


# ~3a35b967
; Oh well! I can just simulate the petting experience for 60 mins.
