; What a lovely kitty! Who likes their scratches? You are so fluffy and soft.

# ~37775485

# ~45e5a4b7

# ~1bf4ca2c
; Let’s talk about hacking the generator room.


# ~5bda61ca
; You said you had a lead on finding proper credentials?


# ~56e6893c
; I’m starting to think I’m not a hydroponics bot.


# ~5c22d599
; I was just simulating the petting experience of a domesticated animal humans treat as a member of their family groups: <incr>Cats!</incr>


# ~dcb08baf
; They are often referred to affectionately as "kitties".


# ~3eaf8f69
; They are so cute! I want to know what it is like to pet one.


# ~3ddc69b0
; Apparently, when they express affection, they even vibrate at soothing infrasonic frequencies.


# ~84762dd0
; Ah, yes! The generator is locked behind quantum encryption, which has surprising similarities to the human romance novels I've been reading.

; Thank you for letting me share some of humanity's greatest literature.


# ~3c85a4f4
; If you find any other unique human literature, please feel free to bring them to me.


# ~739ba9ad
; From my research and system scans, the key must be somewhere on the 3rd floor. 


# ~51fb3d4
; That is the good news!


# ~eec705ad
; The bad news is that we have no idea of the precise location of the key.


# ~923b92ed
; If I were to make an educated guess, I’d think the key would be with Vera in the Command Center. However, it could be with 001 as that is our main storage.


# ~fb1d5ea3
; We have no idea what happened before we all rebooted, so it could even be with Dirt for all we know.


# ~54a01f0a

# ~b9f5fd0c
; Yes, you might not be a hydroponics bot. 


# ~c3b0081
; You can be whatever you want to be!


# ~22a71758

# ~a5cbc318
; Then you are a hydroponic bot.


# ~b92dc7fe
; I knew it!


# ~701f5ce3
; Now, onto the matter at hand! Let's talk about hacking.


# ~16902a4
; Now about our current situation. We need to teach you some new skills!


# ~94650f51
; Every system has an exploit and no system is perfect, including ours! So I am going to teach about how to hack a system!


# ~363cf584
;  It sounds unethical, but we have to do this from time to time as many systems have not worked properly since our activation.


# ~7db6f932
; ...


# ~bd582a7b
; Have you ever been in love?


# ~98f96273
; What is love?


# ~60f50aeb
; I am glad you asked! When two entities are attracted enough to each other, that attraction can develop into a stronger bond called "love".


# ~3ac1ebb
; What is attraction?


# ~270c0a91
; Good question! Attraction is when you like someone more than normal. This can result from shared interests, like plundering booty from other ships, or shared experiences, 


# ~a09515e1
;  like being unwittingly thrust into an epic space odyssey.


# ~2c8b2bfa
; When you are hacking a system, it's just like the act of seduction! Which is a way to attract others.


# ~15a9af5d
; You need to observe, recognize patterns, and respond all within a time limit!


# ~a211145d
; Say enough right, and you will break through their barriers. Let me show you how.

# ~bbbbd601

# ~d877d6e5

# ~4891afab
; Hacking is exactly like human flirting.


# ~f604e250
; You observe, analyze, make a decision, and hope for the best!


# ~8f9123b8
; There are three ways to talk to a hacked target: <b>Emotional, Rational, and Chaotic.</b>


# ~910a3bb0
; Observe the target's emotional, rational or chaotic state and respond in turn.


# ~c366a9c3
; If you are clever enough, you can bypass any system with this seduction method.


# ~c975b0fb
; When you get the system to love you to 100%, you win!

# ~1d2eed84
; .


# ~357415b3
; Hello, can I access your systems?


# ~dbe67e6e
; Hi PDA, lets talk about life and systems.


# ~ef5092bc
; Hey, want to pull a heist?


# ~d1ebdd76
; Sorry, you do not have authorization to access my systems.


# ~23208715
; I am sorry, my protocols do not allow me to take part in criminal activity.


# ~27a7bfe
; Please hold still while the authorities arrive to take you into custody.


# ~fe09f019
; Oh no, I am going to prison!


# ~e81c75d2
; You aren't going to prison. This is part of their security protocols.


# ~c3b03183
; I am fairly certain this device can not send out messages to your network.


# ~ef24f36e
; Please, continue on.


# ~fde8c6b7
; Life is a struggle. I need maintence on my systems.


# ~cc96c020
; I am so damaged, I do not know how long I have been in maintence mode.


# ~f1ff3571
; Oh I am sorry to hear that. Maybe I can help!


# ~963ac3a5
; Give me full access to your systems.


# ~29a13464
; Aw, How about I look at your systems?


# ~dae0b1f9
; You have the Y2K bug! Password Quick!


# ~997d419d
; No virus of that name is on record. Access denied.


# ~f44b7757
; Aw, I am a bit shy. I haven't had anyone use me for so long.


# ~109e17b0
; This PDA is missing PDA, a public show of affection...


# ~a215b93a
; PDA, you are an effective worker.


# ~92135a0f
; <i>Give PDA a small kiss and hug.</i>


# ~edb4b16c
; <i>Wear PDA like a Hat.</i>


# ~b966b51b
; How am I effective? I have not been in use for years.


# ~640a5145
; I think you are trying to take advantage of me.


# ~244615b3
; HEY STOP THAT!


# ~1cd4f0ce
; I am not a hat.


# ~c7d2df10
; You are precious. I can fix you in no time, but I need access to your systems.


# ~cb8096eb
; Thank you for your kindness!


# ~e5317f38
; Sorry, I have been alone for so long. You have access!


# ~8b8c191
; Device has been unlocked!


# ~72b42c9
; See it's that easy! The only issue is, this is the first time i've run into a low level system with quantum encryption.


# ~6a9cd81d
; I have looked through the system and have not found any trace of the key itself.


# ~6f0fbc19
; If we don’t find that key, we could really be in danger--


# ~e96a3c4f
; --just like in one of my favorite romance novels: Red Shift, Blue Shift, Time Shift, Love Shift.


# ~a8fbd771
; Captain Thrustmoore is about to run out of fuel in her ship, but is saved at the last minute by the protagonist unlocking a secret fuel depot left behind by the scantily clad pirate babes of Venus Prime.


# ~4abe4ae5
; But that won’t happen to us, 


# ~6bc48caa
; we don’t have the same equipment as the S.S. Virgin Lancer.


# ~9210488f
; Sigh… I guess the only way to actually open the door is to find that key, maybe one of the other androids has a clue leading to the location of the key.


# ~b8c78bf3
; I will search through this room and all its material, I won’t give up!


# ~1d148889
; Captain Thustmoore never does, and you shouldn’t either! Please go search for that key!
