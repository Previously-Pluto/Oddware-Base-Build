Hello!
Thanks for purchasing my shader! :D

LCD Shader:
-Place any image, video, or RenderTexture you'd like into the "Screen" slot.
-The screen resolution can be changed to any dimension through the "Pixel H/W" values. Be sure to also change the "PixelTexture" tiling to fit your resolution.
-Gamma correction and brightness can be applied via the slider.

CRT Shader:
-Place any image, video, or RenderTexture you'd like into the "Screen" slot.
-The screen resolution can be changed to any dimension by the tiling the "x" value on "PixelTexture".
-Gamma correction and brightness can be applied via the slider.
-The darkness, speed, and height of scanlines can be changed with their respective sliders.
-Noise can be adjusted by the slider.
-Screen position can be raised or lowered via the Vertical Adjustment slider (mostly used for animations).

Pixels textures can be edited easily, though the best result with automaded mip maps are:
-32x32 resolution
-Kaiser mip map filtering
-Trilinier filter mode at 16x ansio level
-RGB 24bit format in compression (this one is key to keeping the color correct when viewing distant mip maps)

I've used pixel art anti-aliasing techniques on the pixel textures as three columns of RGB pixels don't fit naturally into the 32x32 resolution.


ChangeLog:

v.2 - Added Noise slider.
