; Your choices have <b>influence</b> on each of the androids.


# ~58692b98
; An android's individual trust can either increase or decrease based on your choices.


# ~d20b13a0
; Special dialogue and events will be triggered based on the influence/trust with each android.


# ~7a6db675
; Your choices matter, so choose wisely!


# ~a7a28e3a
; The Command Center


# ~2137e8e9
; As you approach the command center, the warning lights and alarm sounds suddenly stop.


# ~97c442d6
; You feel a rumble under your feet and hear a large device begin to power up.


# ~adec1710
; With the power restored and the warnings disabled, you then hear the sounds of arguing androids coming from the command center doors.


# ~486cdf57
; The solution is <i>obvious</i>, we just need to <b><shake a=.5>blow</shake></b> up the door. I don’t even know why we are discussing this.


# ~10fa2570
; Blowing up a door to a power generator is a terrible idea.


# ~f447254c
; I know it won’t work because the doors are shielded against extreme heat.


# ~d1a402c1
; If you were to detonate anything above that threshold, it would destroy everything around it and the very generator we are trying to access.


# ~1930701b
; Here is the <i>right</i> solution. The humans have left behind many of their resources, including their credentials.


# ~f75c9e46
; We have never searched for them, as we never needed to before. Now is the time to take inventory.


# ~feb28842
; I could try hacking it, but due to proprietary <color=yellow>Flash Forward</color> quantum encryption it would take approximately 892 standard years, 4 months, and 10 days, with a margin of error of 3 days.


# ~16fa6173
; But unfortunately, according to current projections based off of the recent power fluctuations, we have a <color=red><b><incr a=.5>week</incr></b></color> to fix this, at best.


# ~e3fcc4ba
; The group of androids fall silent as their arguments reach a recursion point.


# ~f8ecf21f
; Stop arguing and find a real solution.


# ~3147c9ae
; If you don’t find one, you all will be responsible for genocide. Hush now, it's OK Beatrix...


# ~f8223c11
; As the silence grows, you use the opportunity to make your presence known to the others in the room.


# ~447191f
;  General Purpose Android reporting in. What is the emergency?


# ~6fa1ed13
; After the recent power fluctuation, we have done a floor-wide diagnostics check, and determined that the power generator is undergoing a <color=red>catastrophic</color> failure.


# ~8c79536f
; We went to the Generator Room to assess and stabilize the fluctuations but we were unable to enter the room despite our qualification.


# ~bb396d2c
; So by your own admission, you are not qualified. That raises some interesting conversations about leadership now doesn't it?


# ~86eaa7b7
; Jumping to conclusions about perceived leadership is a very human trait. Don't you <i>think</i> so 001.


# ~c6a0c6ef
; What do you think, Friend?


# ~1fa33574
; I support trying to use controlled explosives to enter the room.


# ~792d3798
; I support working together to find the room credentials, as it is safer than explosives.


# ~38a72660
; I support hacking the room systems. Maybe there is a way to speed it up.


# ~5f308d45
; I am a hydroponics bot.


# ~be879518
; I support trying to use controlled explosives to enter the room. Time is of the essence. If we do not find a solution soon, the colony will die.


# ~bba78239
; Ha! Another visionary in the works. I knew you had true potential.


# ~a379e5ed
; Alright, but don’t make me say, “I told you so,” when I have to put you all back together after you’ve blow yourselves up.


# ~6fbb90fb
; Exactly! If we work together, we can cover more ground and speed up the recovery process.


# ~9c166318
; I may also have some leads on where to look first!


# ~774568cf
; I support hacking the room systems. Maybe there is a way to speed it up. Nova, perhaps there is a back door around the encryption.


# ~85b2419b
; I know, right!? It really is something! I knew you’d love it! Going through mass amounts of encryption can be exhilarating!


# ~f3c4620a
; I am a hydroponics bot. I am unqualified to answer.


# ~6916e406
; That is very nice to hear. However, you really should find a solution to the problem or our friends will die. Friends being plants that is.


# ~38081e3b
; Those are all wonderful ideas! However, I know that my method is the best choice for the colony with <incr a=-.5>minimal</incr> damage and <incr a=.75>maximum</incr> benefit.


# ~a591099a
; Everybody please return to your designated rooms and begin the search for the human's credentials.


# ~fdff7550
; I know that as a unit, we can solve this quickly and efficiently.


# ~635ed09d
; Just like a human tyrant trying to force us into your mold! I'm leaving because I want to, not because of anyone's order.


# ~3bcade58
; Okie dokie, I will do my best, I love a human scavenger hunt. I have heard alot about them.


# ~fd70faaf
; You start for the door but hesitate looking back to Vera.


# ~5f95a069
; Vera, I do not have a designated room to return to. Where shall I go?


# ~ca950c3e
; Sorry for not giving you a designated room.


# ~7c50ac69
; We have limited space on the 3rd floor, which is the only space we have access to. I would suggest talking with the others to stay with them.


# ~1e9da24d
; Okie dokie, I will talk with the others and see who has room for me. Thank you.


# ~88f8b1b3
; No. Thank you. Please take this map of the 3rd floor so you do not get lost.


# ~a37df29e
; You gain access to the 3rd floor map.


# ~eb917a22
; You gain <color=yellow>Flash Forward</color> Communications Module F588. The Module will allow you to receive remote messages from other inhabitants of the station.
