# ~86584c6a
; You step out of the hydroponics lab and walk the halls with <color=#C6AEE5><b>Nova</b></color>.


# ~cc46b200
; Sorry about that! Dirt has a tendency to get carried away when it comes to plants.


# ~e3cd0f88
; They are really not too bad once you get to know them.


# ~e72251aa
; But enough about Dirt- Let’s talk about <b><incr>you!</incr></b>


# ~c397652
; You are a new android that I do not know.


# ~8b460e52
; Isn’t that <b><bounce>exciting!?</bounce></b>


# ~dfec45a5
; I wonder what personality you will develop, what habits you’ll form, what strange <b><bounce>idiosyncrasies</bounce></b> your algorithms will integrate!


# ~3caee5b3
; Think of the <b><bounce>possibilities!</bounce></b>


# ~77c66b12
; But look at <i>me</i>, I’m getting ahead of myself again. I haven’t even asked you about yourself.


# ~53456e8d
; What’s your favorite color? Do you like sunsets?


# ~c3429bcf
; What’s your favorite kind of cat? What’s your favorite prime number?


# ~2cafa77d
; Do you ever wonder what it’d be like to taste strawberries?


# ~9a4842a2
; Want to see my favorite spot in the colony? What do you remember before being activated?


# ~fe8bd4b3
; Do you know where you are or what you are supposed to do?


# ~e0c24d93
; I am a Hydroponics bot.


# ~99fc22eb
; I don’t know… I don’t remember anything before activation.


# ~204eb0e
; I remember a black void, and some shimmering light, but nothing else.


# ~49fc90de
; So you know nothing.


# ~4b8432d3
; How wonderful! I get to observe you as you experience everything for the first time.


# ~4ce00175
; Think of all the behavioral data I could collect!


# ~2416f1ce
; It’s interesting how you only answered one out of eight questions, though. We’ll get back to the rest later!


# ~f5189e5a
; For now, what experience should I introduce you to first…


# ~a229741d
; I know exactly the thing! A full tour of our floor of the colony, starting with my favorite place.


# ~5bed0160
; Unfortunately, the other floors are locked...


# ~ed17d89e
; But there’s still plenty of things to show you here.


# ~b5807655
; I can’t wait to see the look on your face-screen when you see my favorite place.


# ~f185ecfc
; I’m. So. <b><bounce>Excited.</bounce></b>


# ~348cf082
; Is this a utility closet?


# ~59cab12e
; Yes! Isn’t it <b>great!?</b> Humans used to use this closet!


# ~d47e6047
; I guess so-


# ~69764de
; And that mop over there has even touched human hands at one point! Can you believe it!?


# ~71c62cf1
; There are even epidermal cells on the handle. Did you know humans constantly shed all kinds of cells.


# ~1b503178
; It’s so weird, I <i>love</i> it!


# ~ac30ca22
; Well, it’s certainly something…


# ~c7b78dc0
; Ew! Humans shed what?


# ~c28816c0
; Wait, a human touched that? Are humans here?


# ~c0986ff5
; Why do you care if a human has touched that?


# ~fff81875
; I know, right!? It really is something! I knew you’d love it! Just wait until you see my second favorite spot!


# ~85dad299
; Yeah, it’s so gross! That’s what makes it fascinating. I knew you’d love it! Just wait until you see my second favorite spot!


# ~a083b204
; Yes, it’s so amazing; it’s difficult to believe!  Humans used to live here.


# ~ac81b1f4
; Unfortunately, we don’t know what happened to them.


# ~1578c373
; The other floors above are locked, so they could be up there. Why they’d lock us down here, rather than have us help them maintain the colony, is beyond me.


# ~999c8d1a
; Perhaps they are unhappy with us, or worse maybe something happened to them...


# ~84f674d2
; But, there’s no sense in moping about what we don’t even know. Let me show you my second favorite spot.


# ~111067d6
; Because humans created us: we wouldn’t exist without them.


# ~986b023
; In fact, this whole colony wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for them!


# ~9f612c39
; Plus, I’ve read so much about them, and they are extremely intriguing. I don’t see how anyone wouldn’t be enthralled.


# ~c2d62648
; Anyway, let me show you my second favorite spot.


# ~53030f34
;  and <color=#C6AEE5>Nova</color> walk around the Colony's 3rd floor discovering new locations and insight on the Humans.


# ~104786ac
; As 


# ~25a58a2f
;  and <color=#C6AEE5>Nova</color> enter a hallway leading to the next set of rooms in Nova’s tour, a voice is heard from the hallway speaker.


# ~9360c892
; Would all unassigned android personnel report to command for function review.


# ~c69f3cc2
; Well darn, I was going to show you my third favorite mop closet, but seeing as you are the only unassigned android I should probably take you to Vera so you can be assigned a function.


# ~5ba292fc
; <wave>Ooo!</wave> I can't wait to see what function Vera assigns you!
