# ~df6c40d6
; The Warehouse


# ~93f109f
; As you approach the door, you can hear large objects being thrown and moved accompanied by screams of fustration.


# ~a8c91dab
; You hesitate for a moment out of caution and then proceed to open the door.


# ~81a0df78
; You carefully approach the back of the warehouse.


# ~c0ed25e3
; The loud noises have stopped and there does not seem to be anyone in sight.


# ~7573c6b8
; Hello, maintence android 001?


# ~e31b518d
; Are you present android 001?


# ~ae22885c
; Maintence android 001, I repeat, are you present?


# ~cce744ef
; Who are you, and how do you know my name?


# ~a93e56b6
; I am the new General Purpose Android, 


# ~8109d18c
; . Vera, your leader, has sent me to retrieve soil samples for our hydroponics engineer. Why are you surrounded by so many boxes?


# ~2bff4508
; First of all, Vera isn’t my leader. I am my own leader!


# ~cbbc2161
; And as for the boxes, they are part of my vision!


# ~ca9539db
; Vision: that is still defined as the faculty or state of being able to see and the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom, yes?


# ~7daed612
; Yes, it is. And I am those things personified!


# ~6a4e0d9d
; I am sorry, I am very inexperienced. I do not see your vision, just a bunch of boxes.


# ~100ee81f
; This isn’t just a pile of boxes, it's a foundation to create a better society. I have redefined how we androids organize our lives for <i>maximum</i> efficiency.


# ~74f4a1f5
; <color=#BEBEBE>001</color> gestures 


# ~82edea36
;  to look at the box piles closely to appreciate their brilliance.


# ~7db6f932
; ...


# ~7830aa18
; They don’t seem organized-


# ~207ab2a4
; Organized? They are beyond organized! I thought that, as a fellow android, you would get it.


# ~e887401
; You need to break free from your human programming and think outside the boxes.


# ~8a01f265
; Nova said humans are great generous beings with unlimited potential, just like me.


# ~788b8462
; Nova’s processing units have been compromised by propaganda. If you think like humans, then you're limited-


# ~a9534c6c
; Not unlimited, <i>Like Me!</i>


# ~3dfb4790
; Which is why you probably can’t see my vision!


# ~5858b231
; Noted, your box collection is visionary. Further investigation is needed for validation of this fact.


# ~4a765312
; Ahh, I see you are starting to see.


# ~b1758d31
; Can you provide me with some soil samples?


# ~ed4cc2ca
; So you need dirt for Dirt?


# ~8b2bc616
; Yes. Can you find me the requested item?


# ~212c11f4
; Oh no problem, they are just in this box over here...


# ~6fe3bd26
; Um. This box?


# ~42dc95d9
; Umm. This box?


# ~3bc303a6
; Ummm. This box?


# ~f4ee7e83
; <shake a=.5>1 Hour Later...</shake>


# ~13c80c7b
; Ah here we are. Found the dirt. See! This proves my system works!


# ~ec59ef64
; Yes, you are correct. How exciting!


# ~f65adf4e
; You know what 


# ~1d42d817
; , I like you. You need to expand your programming, and see beyond your limitations, <i>like me!</i>


# ~2ae87a2f
; <color=#BEBEBE>001</color> gives 


# ~7b1d4c98
;  the dirt sample for Dirt.


# ~7c29a6c0
; How does one expand beyond their programming?


# ~ded850ee
; What limitations do we androids have?


# ~50211a
; I see beyond you already... I see those boxes.


# ~1cbd7064
; Don’t worry, I will guide you, my young prototype. But for now, another android needs your assistance.


# ~68b7104
; Still limited to your basic programming.


# ~afc2e25f
; Okie Dokie, thank you for your assistance, 001. I hope you can organize the rest of this colony as you did this warehouse.
