# ~acbf2e85
; "I created the predictive models, and I am never wrong."


# ~a0305854
; "What if you are wrong this time?" Anya asks.


# ~a84e1ab3
; "Have I ever let you or the Coalition down?"


# ~7da62e4a

; We can finally become a major force in the Coalition. I already have their attention.”


# ~9a6a7493
; Sarah is a savant.


# ~8f47c59c
; The science of creating a savant is widely practiced in the field of genetic engineering. However, even with 300 years of genetic experimentations rarely does a savant actually appear. A savant has unlimited potential, which means they can learn and be proficient at anything. It is known that the most powerful board members of the Sol Prime Galactic Coalition were born savants.


# ~6889079f
; (offset)The myth of the savant(/offset) continues on with the latest discovery of the first intergalactic highway by a savant and promises of riches with that title can obtain.


# ~f7720400
; “My predictions are always accurate, I have heard that people even call me an Oracle- a mystic of science. I actually laughed at the contradiction.”


# ~7f49cc7a
; “Listen, people put so much hope in my work that they use it as irrefutable evidence in court. Once a woman used my predictive model to reverse a court decision on ownership of a new synthesis material making her one of the richest women in existence. Another time a man used my models to discover anomalies all around the galaxy leading to the <b>The Goldilocks Rush.</b>”


# ~5f5d0b9b
; Sarah tells her story with a hollow jubilance. She tightens her mask.


# ~248ae928
; This, she exclaims, is why her label of <b>savant</b> isn’t just for show.

# ~778cb049
; (horiexp)She takes Anya’s hands into hers and they stand looking at the defiant tree on the hill.(/horiexp)


# ~4c2a8994
; “They asked me to go. For a trip this difficult, you need someone to actually be there to adjust the navigational models for a realistic prediction even with my data models. I have a chance to change history- to live up to my label.”


# ~7a47e45e
; Anya nods and tightens her grip on Sarah’s hand.


# ~b09c0d75
; Anya has known Sarah for years as a shy introvert saddled by the attention of being named a savant. It was only recently that Sarah broke out of their shell and started bringing people into their sheltered life. Anya was glad she was one of those special people.


# ~69ae9096
; “The other scientists don’t like me very much.”


# ~6850e531
; “Why so?” Anya asks


# ~3139f858
; “I make their lives harder. Half of them think the public are too dependent on my predictive models from software to hardware. That I am a walking monopoly- the antithesis of their free market. The other thinks I haven’t earned any of my accomplishments because of how I was born.”


# ~f792d419
; Sarah speaks with a certain hardness to her voice.


# ~37a139b8
; Sarah and Anya stand there in front of the hill.

; “I am going to do it you know. Change history.”


# ~1aa10a78
; “I know. You always are.” Anya laughs.


# ~e06246fc
; “Ok, I am ready to face them. Shall we go back to the party?”


# ~53ed6095
; Sarah offers her right arm out to Anya and they slowly walk away from the hillside together.

# ~9173da9d
; The ship, The Dawnstar, shakes and creaks. Warning sounds blare and the ship's lights turn red.


# ~22ca553a
; Sarah starts to sweat. The ship shakes so much it starts to blur her vision.


# ~bbc0f8e8
; “We need to hold for 30 minutes Earth relative time. Put shields to match the incoming pressure wave.” She shouts to the pilot.


# ~c6c316e7

# ~b4da61c
; She was right that they could target the IBA jump points to locations. This is a breakthrough that should be celebrated. However, she realized a celebration would be pointless if they couldn’t communicate back to the SPGC.

# ~434ca26e
; Questions raced through Sarah’s head.


# ~c2ab47e2
; She had done all the calculations and created the perfect model with the available data. Perhaps there wasn’t enough data for a complete model? Perhaps it was a failure in the manufacturing of the experimental drive parts? Perhaps there was sabotage?
